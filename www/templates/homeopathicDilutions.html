      <p style="color:#000000;">What does the “C” listed after the active ingredient stand for?</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">The most common type of dilutions is “C” dilutions (centesimal dilutions). The 1C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the Mother Tincture with 9 parts of ethanol in a new vial and then vigorously shaking the solution (succussion). The result is a 1/100
        dilution of the plant (the Mother Tincture being a 1/10 dilution of the plant itself). The 2C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the 1C with 99 parts of ethanol in a new vial and succussing. Recurrently, the 3C is obtained by mixing 1 part of the
        2C with 99 parts of ethanol in a new vial and succussing.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">What does the “X” listed after the active ingredient stand for? X dilutions are decimal dilutions prepared similarly to C dilutions, but the factor of dilution is only 1/10 from one dilution to the next.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">What does the “K” listed after the active ingredient stand for? The K refers to a method of manufacturing known as the Korsakovian method. The Korsakovian method dilutes the homeopathic preparation of the substance at the rate of 1 part of the previous
        dilution with 99 parts of solvent.</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">What does the “CK” listed after the active ingredient stand for? Korsakovian dilutions are manufactured using a device specially designed to ensure that the dilution process is reproducible from one dilution to the next. Only one vial is used for
        the entire process. Using ultra-purified water as the solvent, the machine removes 99% of the Mother Tincture and replaces it with the same volume of solvent. The vial is succussed for 10.5 seconds. The result is called 1CK. The 2CK is prepared
        identically from the 1CK. The automatic process using only 1 vial allows higher dilutions to be reached. The most common Korsakovian dilutions are 200CK, 1,000CK (also called 1M), 10,000CK (10M), 50,000 CK (50M) and 100,000CK (100M or CM).</p>

      <p style="color:#000000;">What does “200CK” mean? 200CK means that the substance has been homeopathically diluted 200 times at the rate of 1 to 100.</p>
